# Bevy Foo

A game development tutorial for [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org) inspired
by [Lazy Foo's SDL2 tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net)

Bevy Engine does have tons of learning materials (tutorials and examples).
You can check them out [here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/)

Having said that, Lazy Foo has been a great resource for me while learning
[SDL](https://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/index.php)/[SDL2](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)
and [OpenGL](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/OpenGL/index.php).
 
I wish to provide a similar experience for those coming to learn Bevy.
Bear in mind that I'm still learning Bevy myself, so come along with the ride.

The format of this Bevy Engine tutorial is going to be using
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
